                <p>
                    Unlike most people, I have an unusual and rather mobile childhood. I was born in the USSR in the 80s but grew up Vietnam.
                    At 8 years old, I moved to Perth - a city in the westcoast of Australia - with my family. For 6 years,
                    my life was a constant relocation to different countries around the South Pacific due to my dad's job.
                    In 2000, I received a scholarship to attend a boarding school in London, so I packed my bag and moved
                    to the UK. I spent 5 years in London and on a random night in my senior year, my friend mentioned America.
                    I knew at the time that a new adventure had called my name, so a year later I moved across the Atlantic
                    to America to attend college. I finally landed in Chicago in the Fall of 2009 to start my PhD at Northwestern.
                    I have been at the institution since then as a student, fellow and now a research staff.
                    <br> As a career scientist, my research at Northwestern focused on developing new therapeutic strategy
                    for diseases. We employed a new found technology which used materials at nanoscale level to deliver active
                    drugs to the disease sites. Our technology have worked in various diseases ranging from cancer to wound
                    healing. My current endeavor is to apply this technology in immune diseases, especially ones trigger
                    by viral infection. You can see more of my recent research at

                    <br> I enjoy traveling, working out and living a healthy lifestyle. I've spent a lot of my time volunteering
                    with LGBT organizations. I'm a member of the Chicago Gay Men's Chorus, the outNETWORK at Feinberg School
                    of Medicine, Chicago Pride Parade Organization, The National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance. I
                    also volunteer for the Center on Halsted and Howard Brown health. Please visit these websites for further
                    information about these organizations
